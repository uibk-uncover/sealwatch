    Pre-computes the locations which histograms can be merged based on the following symmetry considerations:
    - Convolve the spatial image with each of the 64 DCT basis functions. The result is called undecimated DCT.
    - The distribution of each individual mode is approximately symmetrical and centered at 0. Under this assumption, we can take the absolute value.
    - Exploiting the absolute values and the symmetry of projection vectors, the histograms can be merged.
