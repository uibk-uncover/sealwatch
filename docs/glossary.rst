JPEG and DCT
------------

JPEG is a lossy image format.
Because of its popularity, it is a good target for steganography, typically done on top of DCT coefficients.
To read coefficients from JPEG and write them back, we encourage you to use our other project, `jpeglib <https://pypi.org/project/jpeglib/>`__.
In its `glossary <https://jpeglib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html>`__, you can find a lot of details on JPEG specifically.
